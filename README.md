Most of the structural connectome datasets used are available publicly. See _S01 Appendix_ for a description of the datasets, references to the original publications and download information (when applicable).

Except for the Mouse1, Human3, Human4, Human5 and ZebraFinch1 datasets, which have been shared with us privately, the corresponding edgelists (i.e., the structural connectome) is also available.
